# Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard
*SQL (BigQuery) + Tableau Public*

## 📌 Project Objective
To analyze sales and customer data from a simulated-ecommerce platform using SQL and visualize business insights in Tableau. The objective is to identify sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior across regions and time periods to support business decision-making.

## 📊 Tools Used
- **Google BigQuery (Sandbox)** - SQL queries & data extraction
- **Tableau Public** - Dashboard creation & visual storytelling
- **GitHub** - Version control and project sharing
- **Google Docs / Word** - Insight summary and reporting

This project uses the public BigQuery dataset:
**`bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`**

Key tables:
- `users` - customer profiles
- `orders` - purchase transactions
- `order_items` - products in each order
